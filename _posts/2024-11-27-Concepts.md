# Web Agents
These are extremely lightweight, web addressable microservers designed to help with the integration
problems that arise when making systems work together.

Here are some examples of web agents:

  - `jane.doe.family` is a personal agent unique to one person, able to interact with business systems, websites or other web agents. For
    example, this might provide automatic login so Jane can forget passwords, provide a 2FA capability, allow Jane to play multiuser
    games or share her identity and selecetd personal data between different businesses.
  - `gateway.acme.com` is a business agent providing a set of services such as gateways for identify verification,
    biometric authentication, Shopify apps and a Twilio gateway to handle outbound text messaging.
  - `s-44-a433100002.iot.neff.com` is an IoT agent paired with a smart domestic appliance, providing
    a set of endpoints for the manufacturer to collect data and provide updates; and for the consumer to manage the smart device.

# How They Work
Web Agents are instantly provisioned by Web Agent Providers, such as Magic ID. Each Web Agent has certain characteristics:

1. A unique hostname on the internet. This is assigned by the Web Agent Provider, who may allow
   customers to BYOD (bring your own domain); or assign a host name at random such as `4ae66.acme.com`; or provide
   vanity domains (such as `jane.doe.family`).
   The ability to instantaneously install and remove server code (i.e. provide custom app backends).
2. The ability to sign requests sent to other systems, which can then be sure who they are talking to.
3. The ability to request scopes on specific apps on other web agents, authorising API calls as appropriate.

# Web Agent Shell
Each individual web agent is controlled by you (or whoever owns it) using the shell.

This is just a website with suitable security keys that means you can:

1. Install, remove, share and run apps listed on the shell's home display.
2. Add and remove devices such as browser instances that control the web agent.
3. Copy files and directories to and from the web agent private drive.
4. Start, stop and view the logs of installed apps, for example during development or when in use.

# Web Agent Apps
All websites are web agent apps already.

But if the website is _savvy_ and checks for a signed web agent token, then it can be sure who made the request (e.g. `jane.doe.family`).
Moreover, if the token requests the appropriate scope, it can be used to make API calls on the requesting web agent
on the endpoint provided by some specific app loaded in that agent.

Endpoints come and go as apps are installed and removed from the agent. Generally, endpoints installed by a given app are
used by that same app which provides a signed token in its requests.

But equally, an app can create a public endpoint requiring no token for authentication or authorization.

A website that doesn't check for a signed web agent token is known as a _dumb site_, and the app runs as an _orphan app_.

# Web Agent Drive
Every web agent has a private drive, like Google Drive only simpler because it provides a folder structure exactly like
the drive inside your Mac or PC.

Folders and files can be marked as _public_ or _private_ (the default). Thus, you can upload a directory from your
Mac or PC containing an app that you have developed and make it available for others to enjoy.
