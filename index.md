Welcome to the Web Agent developer resources page.

Use the links above to navigate introductory material and examples. After
reading the [Concepts]({{ "/blog/2024/11/27/Concepts.html" | relative_url }}) page, the best place to go is probably the [Hello World](#) app.

You'll see newly added pages appear in the list below, so check back periodically to
see if new stuff has been added which can help you in your own work.

You are welcome to join our [Discord Server](https://some.server) where you will be able
to ask questions directly and see what other people are experiencing as the community grows.
